smilebot - a little twitter bot that randomly tweets compliments at its followers

# Usage

* get a consumer API key via https://dev.twitter.com/apps . You'll need a read-write key, which means you have to add your phone to your account.
* get a user OAuth token with get_access_token.py from https://github.com/leonardr/sycorax
* put those in twitterapi.py

# Todo

* allow users to set frequency for messages
* allow users to suggest messages, and collect those somehow
* run somewhere other than local commandline :)
